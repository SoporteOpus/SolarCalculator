# SolarCalculator

This project aims to develop an interactive, modular, and customizable solar calculator that can be easily integrated into multiple client websites. The application will allow users to estimate the potential annual savings (in â‚¬) from installing solar panels, providing accurate results based on parameters such as energy consumption, location, installation type, and other relevant factors.
